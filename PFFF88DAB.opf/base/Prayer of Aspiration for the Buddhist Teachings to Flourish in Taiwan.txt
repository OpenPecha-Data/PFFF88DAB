My noble dharma friend, a trilingual śramaṇa follower of Śākyamuni named Tendzin Ögyel offered
as many thousand Taiwanese dollars as there are emblems of royalty [i.e., seven], together
with an auspicious silken scarf, and requested that I compose some verses of aspiration
for the creation of favourable conditions and the pacification of unfavourable circumstances
and obstacles, so that the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha might flourish and spread
here in Taiwan. Thus, merely to avoid refusing this request, I, the one who merely holds
the name of the head of the Ngagyur Nyingma tradition, Katok Getrul Gyurme Tenpa Gyaltsen,
wrote this on the eighth day of the seventh month of the Earth Dog year (18 August 2018).
May virtue and excellence abound! Sarva maṅgalam.
